[1] the term ‘acting offensively’ in this connection is used to cover      primitive conduct of the kind which is supposed to attract wicked      and violent men, as, for example, carrying off your neighbour’s      wife, raping his daughter, stealing his spoons, bashing in or      otherwise mutilating his face, and so forth.now the man who makes the laws is in one sense like the man who haslearnt how to become invisible. i do not mean that he can break thelaws with impunity, but he can see to it that he has no incentive tobreak them. thus we have the majestic impartiality of the modern lawwhich forbids rich and poor alike to sleep in doorways. he can also, asthrasymachus points out, ensure that, so long as others keep them, hisown power will be automatically safeguarded. and, since the law is atonce the prop and the mirror of the public opinion of the community,and, since the public opinion of the community is in matters of conductat once the guardian and the arbiter of conventional morality, we mayfurther say that the habit of acting in a way of which the publicopinion of the community approves will be found to conduce to themaintenance of the _status quo_, and hence to the interests of thosewhom the _status quo_ suits.in the early eighteenth century bernard mandeville revived andelaborated the doctrine of thrasymachus. society was devised byskilful politicians for their own advantage. this they hoped chieflyto secure by the spread of what was called morality. addressingthemselves, therefore, to men’s pride, they pointed out that man hadalways considered himself to be superior to the brute beasts. yet, ifhe indulged his passions as soon as he conceived them and gave wayalike to sensual desire and violent rage, wherein did his superiorityconsist? surely in order to demonstrate their superiority men mustlearn to master their appetites and restrain their passions. the plainman listened to the words of the flatterer, and, aspiring to livethe higher life, transformed himself from a savage into a clerk. theprocess is known as civilization.tamed by his own conceit, man was now fit to live in society. as asocial animal he regards as virtuous every action on the part of othersby which the society to which he belongs is benefited, and stigmatizesas vicious the indulgence of private appetites irrespective of thepublic good.but the skilful politicians who had planned the thing from thebeginning had taken good care to ensure that the good of societyshould be identical with their own advantage. uncivilized man isungovernable man, but man tamed and tractable, with the bees of socialvirtue and social service buzzing in his citizen’s bonnet, is at oncethe prop and the dupe of unscrupulous governments. “from which”, asmandeville says, “it is evident that the first rudiments of moralitybroached by skilful politicians to make men useful to each other aswell as tractable, were chiefly contrived that the ambitious might reapthe more benefit from, and govern vast numbers of them with the greaterease and security.”to those who object that morality was invented by god and not bypoliticians, and that the sanctions of right conduct are derived notfrom social utility but from divine ordinance, it should be observedthat god himself is the most potent instrument yet devised for securingthe performance of conduct beneficial to the stronger. this at leastis true of the great bulk of the gods who have figured in history.on this point perhaps it would be best to let the stronger speak forthemselves. napoleon may be taken as a suitable representative.“what is it,” he writes, “that makes the poor man think it quitenatural that there are fires in my parlour while he is dying of cold?that i have ten coats in my wardrobe while he goes naked? that ateach of my meals enough is served to feed his family for a week? it issimply religion which tells him that in another life i shall be onlyhis equal, and that he actually has more chances of being happy therethan i. yes, we must see to it that the floors of the churches are opento all, and that it does not cost the poor man much to have prayerssaid on his tomb.” thenceforward, though an avowed free thinker,napoleon set his face sternly against anti-christian and anti-clericallegislation.the moral is sufficiently obvious. men whose lives are miserableand oppressed will either rise in revolt against their misery andservitude, or console themselves with the prospect of generouscompensation hereafter. if steps are taken to ensure that their faithis sufficiently lively, they will look to the next world to supplythem with the divine equivalents of the champagne and cigars they aremissing in this one, an expectation which confers obvious advantagesupon those whom it enables to monopolize the champagne and cigars.tack on the further belief that riches and power in this world are thebest guarantees of torment and anguish in the next, and the utilityof religion to “the stronger” is sufficiently manifest. the parableof the needle’s eye and the story of lazarus have been responsiblefor a political and social quietism among the many, which do credit tothe political acumen of the early governing class realists who slippedthem into the text of the new testament; and whenever that quietism hasshowed signs of giving, way, a religious revival or the endowment of achurch has usually been found the most effective method of dealing withthe situation.“in 1818 one englishman out of seven being at that time a pauper,parliament voted a million of public money for the construction ofchurches to preach submission to the higher powers. in the debates inthe house of lords, lord liverpool took occasion to lay stress on thesocial importance of guiding by this means the opinions of the masseswho were for the first time beginning to receive education.”[2] god, itseems, is cheaper than a living wage, and no less effective as a meansof securing social contentment.  [2] _the town labourer_, by j. l. and barbara hammond.to its superior utility in this respect we must in part attribute thesuccess of christianity. of all religions known to man it lays thegreatest stress upon those virtues whose practice is advantageous tothe stronger. it glorifies weakness and sentimentalizes over failure;its heaven is for the submissive and the inefficient; its hell forthe dominant and the proud. just as the charitable worker takes therevolutionary edge off poverty by distributing coal and blankets tothe victims of acute industrial distress, so the priest promotessubmissiveness by inculcating the duties of sobriety, meekness,unselfishness, honesty, and contentment. these virtues make goodworkmen and prosperous employers, and, if they are only developedto a sufficient degree, will enable their fortunate possessorscheerfully to put up with bad wages, long hours, wretched houses, andsocial servitude. the contrary virtues of manliness, self-relianceand independence springing from a spirit passionately resentful ofinjustice, quick to resist an injury and idealistically determined tomake a better place of this world instead of waiting passively for thenext one, are discouraged as savouring of pride and self-sufficiency,and as showing a reprehensible tendency to look for help to oneselfinstead of to god, our helper in time of trouble. the rich, to be sure,possess these virtues; but then the message of religion is _from_, not_to_, the rich.but thrasymachus has yet one more observation to make to us beforewe leave him to turn to the future. the penalty of law breaking on asmall scale is prison, and of trivial wickedness, social ostracism.but what of law-breaking on a large scale, and a wickedness powerfulenough to flout the public opinion to which others succumb? these arethe qualities of the stronger and they reap the stronger’s reward. therebel is the patriot who fails, the patriot is the rebel who prevails.this is the lesson of the past, and those who read it may learn thatif only they are strong enough to succeed, they need not troublethemselves about the respectability of their credentials. nor has theposition altered to-day. the man who steals a leg of mutton goes toprison for a month; the captain of industry grown rich on the profitsstolen from his workmen gets a knighthood. the man who has murderedthe wife who has annoyed him gets hanged for his pains; the man whokills his fellow men for nourishment is denounced as a cannibal; butthe great general who plans the death of vast multitudes of his fellowswhom he has never seen, with whom he has never exchanged a cross wordand whom he does not require for purposes of sustenance, is hailed asthe saviour of his country.thus those who commit injustice, yet have the wit or the good fortuneto escape the consequences of their actions, climb into the seats ofthe stronger and share their immunity from moral restrictions. since,in the mere process of gratifying their tastes, they are enabled togive employment to large bodies of their fellows, they are accountedpublic benefactors whose wealth constitutes a social asset. and,should vestiges of the morality of the weaker, from whose ranks theyhave risen, assail them in the form of conscience, they discover thateven the gods can be squared and that a liberal support of deservingcharities, coupled with the occasional endowment of a church, arecalculated――so they are assured――to procure for them as honoured aplace in the hereafter as their own successful injustice has obtainedfor them in the present.thus thrasymachus’ phrase “morality is the interest of the stronger”has a double significance. in the first place, it defines the moralityof the many as that kind of conduct which promotes the interest of thefew; in the second, it assures to the successful few the honourablereputation, the social consideration and the good repute among theirfellows, which are commonly supposed to be the rewards of morality.                              chapter ii             herd morality and the new tyranny of thoughtthe statement of general principles in the preceding chapter wasnot undertaken solely for the pleasure of political and ethicalspeculation. my concern is a more practical one. if the principle thatjustice is the interest of the stronger is the explanation of whatpasses for morality, what, i wish to ask, is its application in thepresent and what is it likely to be in the immediate future?in order to answer these questions we must first consider a furtherone: who in a modern community is the stronger?the fact that we are a democracy has not escaped notice. in our own dayit is not kings, nobles, soldiers, prelates, politicians, or electedpersons who are the stronger, but the common man, the plain man, theaverage man, the man in the street, whether city man or working man,and the crowd or herd of such men. he, or rather his female counterpartsince she is more numerous even than he is, is the arbiter of morality,and the kind of conduct which is called moral is that which isconvenient or pleasing to her.plato with his usual acumen foresaw the possibility of this development,and was careful to provide for it within the bounds of thrasymachus’formula. all that it is necessary to do if we wish to apply the formulato a democracy is to invert it; for ‘stronger’ read ‘weaker’, and theformula remains unaltered. the practicability of this inversion isdemonstrated by one callicles, in the dialogue called _gorgias_.most men are stupid, irresolute, apathetic, mediocre, timid, andunimaginative. the qualities implied by these epithets, thoughdiscernible at all times, force themselves most pressingly upon theattention when men act together. take a sheep and stand it on its hindlegs and its resemblance to a human being is scarcely noticeable; butstand a flock of sheep on their hind legs and, so far as psychology andbehaviour go, you have a crowd of men. in other words, taken severallymen may be individuals; taken together they are a mere transmittingmedium for herd emotion. their individual stupidities are addedtogether, but their individual wisdoms cancel out.in a democracy, says callicles, the common men are the more numerous,they also possess the power; acting, therefore, in accordance withtheir natures, they make the laws which their natures demand. now it isnatural for every man to wish to obtain as much as he can. it is alsoinevitable that in a state of nature the stronger should obtain morethan the weaker. hence the weaker, acting in self-defence, so framethe laws that the endeavour of one individual to obtain more than themany is stigmatized as unjust. hence justice, or morality, which is nowrevealed as the interest of the individually weaker but collectivelystronger, may be regarded as their device for depriving the stronger ofthe preponderance of good things, which the strongers’ superior talentswould naturally procure for them.what we may call herd morality is, therefore, a form of self-defencedictated partly by fear, and partly by envy. the source of the fear isobvious; the envy springs from the natural spite of inferior personswho are conscious of their inferiority, resent it, and wish to takeit out of those who make them feel it. “i have not,” says the averageman, “the capacity of the strong man for acquiring a large share ofthe good things of life. therefore i will take advantage of my numbersto lay it down that such acquisition is wrong and unjust.” the commonview of self-denial may be taken as an illustration. the average manhas neither the courage nor the strength to satisfy his desires andindulge his passions. being unaccustomed to moderation he thinks thatif he permits himself any indulgence he will be unable to stop. he darenot bend for fear he break. hence for the greek virtue of temperancewe get the modern praise of self-denial, with a resultant standard ofmorality which denounces all bodily indulgence as wrong. upon the basisof this standard of morality the principle of sour grapes proceeds tooperate on a large scale. the man who is not rash enough to take sexualpleasure when he finds it, the woman who is not attractive enough tohave the opportunity of being rash, combine to denounce the delights atwhich the independent and the charming are not afraid to grasp.herd morality, which is based on fear and envy, is made effective byblame. in modern society the power to blame is chiefly expressed in twoways. first, by the old whose morality consists in blaming the young;secondly, by the average whose censure descends upon the exceptional.upon the part played by the old in maintaining morality i do not wishto dwell, since it differs little to-day from what it has always been.a mistake which all societies have made is to entrust the managementof their affairs to the old. old men are naturally more vindictive,bad tempered, malevolent, and narrow-minded than young ones. they areeasily provoked to disapproval, and dislike more things than they like.having for the most part lived their own lives, they have nothingleft to do but to interfere in the lives of others. they form thegovernments, misrepresent the people whom they oppress, preach to thepeople whom they exploit, and teach the people whom they deceive. theymete out rewards and punishments, sentence criminals to death, directbusinesses, make laws which they have no temptation to disobey and warsin which they do not propose to fight. if the country were handed overexclusively to the governance of men under thirty-five, and everybodyover that age were forbidden to interfere on pain of being sent to thelethal chamber, it would be a happier and a better place. unfortunatelythe young men are too busy trying to make a living in the subordinatepositions to which the old men grudgingly admit them to have the timeor energy to interfere with other people. besides, being young, theywish to live, a process for which the regulation of the lives of othersis a poor substitute.in the sphere of morality the function of the old is confined todiscovering methods of deterring the young from pleasures of which theythemselves are no longer capable. old men give young men good advice,no longer being able to give them bad examples, and old women inventa symbolic mrs. grundy to intimidate their daughters into resistingthe temptations which now pass them by. the deterrent influences soexercised are called morality under which name they impose on the youngwho will not have caught their elders lying often enough to disbelievethem, until they have begun to produce sons and daughters of theirown, by which time they will be only too ready to abet the prevailinghypocrisy.the other strand in the fabric of modern morality has already beennoticed as the tendency of the weaker to get even with the strongerby taking it out of him on moral grounds. morals, it is thought,are everybody’s privilege and everybody’s possession. few of us canunderstand einstein’s theory of relativity, but we all know thedifference between right and wrong. hence the man who is deficient intalent can make up for it in virtue, and by assuring himself that god’snoblest work is an honest man, put brains and capacity in their properplace.since the motives which have prompted its invention persist unchanged,morality, which has always been the special emanation of the herd,varies little in spite of superficial differences from age to age,whilst intellectuality throws off new lights in every age. there isprobably very little difference between the crowds of ancient babylonand modern clapham, but the mind of einstein differs in radicalparticulars from that of archimedes.realizing that any fool can be good intellectuals have always madelight of morality for the same reasons as those which have caused theherd to set store by it. if the herd has been ready to censure theeccentrics, the eccentrics have been even readier to provide materialsfor censure. despising the mob, they flout their standards and laughat their scruples. the good are so harsh to the clever, the cleverso rude to the good, that one might almost be tempted to believe ina fundamental antipathy between virtue and brains. whether this beso or not, it seems probable that there is a permanent necessity inour natures requiring us to exalt the common qualities we share andunderstand, and to condemn rare gifts. thus morality represents theaverage man’s attempt to console himself in the face of the insultingsuperiority of the few, by proving that the superiority is achievedonly at the cost of loss of virtue. certainly we must take it out ofthese fellows somehow! it tortures our self-respect to admire those whohave qualities we cannot possess. that is why we love to think of thephilosopher as an absent-minded fool, incapable of feeding himself,writing cheques or catching trains, and listen so greedily to thelegends of vice and voluptuousness in men of genius.wickedness in high places is so much more appetizing than wickednessin low; it enables us to prove that those who are inconsiderate enoughto rise above us in place and power, only do so at the cost of fallingbelow us in simplicity and virtue. the public lips have recently beensmacking over the details of a case in which it was alleged that a wifeendeavoured to advance the career of her husband by a liaison with thequarter master general of h.m. forces. it was further alleged that thehusband condoned and even encouraged her conduct. the quarter mastergeneral was a man of marked ability. his organizing and administrativecapacity were justly famous; he was, in fact, one of the few brilliantsuccesses of the war. when the rumour spread that this man, one ofthe most powerful as well as the ablest in the land, had been willingto advance a subordinate because he desired his wife, the outburst ofpublic indignation in the press was tremendous. wickedness in highplaces was a glorious theme: there had been nothing like it since thearmistice. labour bodies met to insist on the superior purity of thelives of working-people, and parsons thundered in their pulpits againstthe luxury of the rich. for several weeks the dennistoun case was thechief subject of conversation in trains, ’buses, and bar-parlours, andthose whose lips smacked the most greedily over the luscious scandalwere the most severe in their condemnation of the vices of society.why was it that this case attracted so much attention? why was thewickedness involved considered so shocking? why did those who wouldnot have looked twice at the six-line paragraph describing a similaroccurrence in the remoter suburbs, follow every detail of the case withthe most avid curiosity? because the woman was unusually beautiful, theman unusually powerful and talented. the beauty of the woman arousedthe envy of other women; the power and talents of the man excited theenvy of other men.we all of us have an impulse to blame those whom life has moregenerously gifted or more fortunately bestowed than ourselves. we makea virtue of our deficiencies, argue that only the dull and lowly aregood, and call the feeling of envy which we experience for those whoare neither dull nor lowly moral indignation.in addition to the envy of the old for the young and of the herd forthe exceptional, the impulse to blame, which men call morality, ownsanother source. this is the desire for uniformity. the desire foruniformity springs in its turn from the fear of insecurity. society,said schopenhauer, is like a collection of hedgehogs driven togetherfor the sake of warmth. the object of social observances is to put feltupon the spikes in order that the proximity of the hedgehogs may notcause them to injure one another. the risk of friction will be reducedto a minimum if all the hedgehogs behave in the same way. identicalbehaviour in all circumstances is, no doubt, an unattainable ideal; butthis makes it doubly important that the herd as a whole should knowwithin limits in what way each of its members _will_ behave. those whoreact unexpectedly to familiar situations, or differ markedly in theirconduct from others are a danger to the herd, causing social frictionand a sense of insecurity. for this reason reformers like christ oribsen, who violently question the standards of thought and conductprevalent in their herd, and refuse to conform to them, are regardedwith bitter hostility.the method by which the herd secures the uniformity of conduct uponwhich its comfort and security depend is the exercise of socialapproval and disapproval. in extreme cases this method is forciblyemployed. the soldier who shows a tendency to run away under theenemy’s fire endangers the safety of his fellows. steps are accordinglytaken to check this tendency by the pressure of social disapproval inthe form of discipline. discipline is a device for substituting thecertainty of being shot for those who do not go over the top for theprobability of being shot for those who do. the result is that mostsoldiers go over the top. this is conduct conducive to the safetyof the herd, and is rewarded with social approval under the name ofcourage.more usually social approval and disapproval find expression in thesphere of manners and modes. in japan under the old laws the term fora rude man is “other-than-expected fellow”, and a noble is not tobe interfered with in cutting down a fellow who has behaved to himin a manner other than is expected. in general, thought or conductcalculated to surprise or disturb the herd incurs disapproval and iscalled immoral; thought and conduct which mirrors the beliefs andhabits of the herd is regarded with approval and is called moral.thus virtue is the habit of acting in a manner of which other peopleapprove; vice in a manner of which they disapprove.summing up, therefore, we may say that social morality in a democracysprings from the envy of the average man for the talents of the ableman which cause him to feel inferior, and from the dislike of the herdfor the conduct of the eccentric which makes it feel unsafe.these are general principles and are more or less applicable in anystate of society which is not a tyranny or a close oligarchy. what iwish to emphasize is their special application to a modern westerndemocracy.in a community of this type the herd is at once more congested andmore powerful than it has been in any other period of history. itscongestion causes it to place a hitherto unparalleled emphasis uponthe necessity for felting the spikes of the hedgehogs, that is tosay, upon the importance of uniformity; its power enables it to ventits disapproval upon those who offend its prejudices with the maximumeffect. this can be seen most clearly in the case of america which hasproduced the most congested[3] and the most powerful herd on record.america is a melting pot in which all the races of the earth are fused.the natural diversity of its elements produces a special need forartificial uniformity in its citizens. a civilization with its roots inthe earth can allow its members to spread outwards, like the branchesof a tree; a civilization, whose seeds are planted in shallow soil,must hedge them about lest they be scattered by the wind. the first iscentrifugal: it can tolerate individuality because it has a centre. thesecond is centripetal: it must enforce uniformity because it has none.  [3] the word ‘congested’ is used to denote the oppression of spiritual      stuffiness rather than of physical overcrowding.for this reason all american citizens strive to be exactly like eachother, and, on the whole, they succeed. they have the same clothes,they live in the same houses, they have the same social habits, thesame respect for money and the same suspicion of such superfluouseccentricities as thought, culture, and art.a friend of mine, who had wintered in a southern state, as the seasonadvanced discarded his felt hat for the regulation straw. a few weekslater he had occasion to travel northwards to new york. as he left thetrain he noticed that he was an object of attention to people on theplatform. porters and loungers stared, and as he walked away from thestation, he found himself followed by a small and apparently hostilecrowd. hailing a taxi, he drove to his hotel. in the porch he met anacquaintance, told him of the notice he had attracted, and asked thereason. his friend explained the matter by pointing to his straw hat.it was too early in new york for the change over into straws, he said,and of course one could not dress differently from other people.the rigid enforcement of uniformity is hostile not only to freedom ofaction but also to independence of thought. the laws against teachingor holding doctrines displeasing to the majority are particularlysevere in america. immigrants, for example, are not allowed to land inamerica until they have first expressed their disbelief in communism,atheism, and free love. many people are put in prison for holdingunpopular views, although these views do no apparent harm to anybody.advocacy of birth-control, possession of irreverent and disreputablebooks such as _jurgen_, expression of subversive opinions with regardto the relationship of capital and labour, and disbelief in god areamong the offences so punished.not only is it necessary not to profess unpopular views――it issometimes necessary to profess popular ones. in order to placate herdopinion it is found necessary to enforce by law the propagationof deliberate falsehood. this happens especially in those cases,unfortunately only too numerous, in which the truth is less gratifyingto human conceit than we could wish, so that its adoption involvesthe abandonment of cherished beliefs. such, for instance, is thebelief that man is a degenerate angel, which is thought to be moreflattering than the truth that he is a promoted ape. thus the stateof tennessee has recently officially repudiated the “monkey ancestry”of its citizens. a law has been passed under which it is illegal forany teacher in a university or other public school to teach anythingdenying the story of creation given in the bible, or that man hasdescended from the lower order of animals, and men have already beenimprisoned for teaching evolution. it is not, so far as i know,maintained even in america that the doctrine of evolution is untrue.it is sufficient that it incurs the disapproval of the stronger.thus truth herself is liable to be stigmatized as immoral if she isinconsiderate enough to flout the wishes of respectable citizens.where individuality is to a large extent obliterated, and citizens arecut according to approved specification by the social machine, nothingis so much valued as personality. i have said that every americanwishes to be like every other american, and so he does――but with adifference. he wants to have a personality of his own. he wishes tohave a something about him that will convey an impression of uniquenessand cause him to be talked about among his fellows. nothing is so muchdiscussed in america as personality. men try to cultivate it as theytry to cultivate biceps; agencies exist in order to tell you how to beunique, and psycho-analysts flourish by the simple process of tellingyou that you are unique.but this is just what the conditions upon which herd morality dependswill not let you be. depart one hair’s-breadth from the standard habitsof thought and accepted codes of conduct, and the herd will make yourexistence intolerable until you consent to toe the line.now the drift of british development follows increasingly the courseset by america. america is our most advanced nation in morals as ineverything else, and, if we want to know what england will be liketo-morrow, we cannot do better than look at america to-day. america isat once a signpost and a stimulus. what american business men are, thatdo our business men strive humbly to be. they ape their magnificence,and enjoy a large and increasing share of this power. the stockbroker’sconception of the good life is becoming increasingly accepted by theclerk, the clerk’s by the shopkeeper, the shopkeeper’s by the workman,so that the community as a whole is doing its best to live up to thestandard which its business men set. so soon as we have got rid of thelast vestiges of our dying aristocracy, such as respect for hunting anda semi-feudal tenantry, we shall subside into an inferior and imitativesatellite of the states.the objects of american civilization are to substitute cleanliness forbeauty, mechanism for men, and hypocrisy for morals. it devotes somuch energy to obtaining the means to make life possible, that it hasnone left to practise the art of living. hot baths and more hot baths,larger and ever larger hotels, faster and ever faster cars, golf playedby ever fatter and more vulgar men, and lap-dogs kept by ever fatterand more vulgar women, cocktails and culture, psycho-analysis and faithhealing, sensual poetry and sensational sport, supported and maintainedby an illiterate governing class ready to be imposed upon by anyquack or charlatan who can persuade it to take an interest in what itimagines to be its soul, such is the probable development of bourgeoiscivilization in england.hints of the growing adhesion of the herd to the ideals and pursuitsof big business are not wanted in current developments of moralsentiment. as the profiteer supplants the aristocrat as the dominantforce in the community, a slight twist is given to the moral opinionsof the herd as a whole in order that they may be brought into line withthe changed interests of the stronger. moral sentiments suitable to theinterests of a hereditary aristocracy of landed proprietors insensiblygive place to a morality designed to protect and safeguard the pursuitsof the fat man on holiday.an example of this process is afforded by the changed attitude tohunting. a hundred years ago hunting was considered an entirelyhonourable pursuit, appropriate to gentlemen and advantageous to thecountryside. to-day it is attacked on humanitarian grounds and voicesare raised in favour of the fox. if he must be killed why not humanely?it was recently reported that a fox chased by the cowdray hounds jumpedthrough the window of a private residence and up the chimney flue.efforts were made to smoke him out by lighting a fire immediatelybelow, for all the world as if he were a boy chimney brush of a centuryago instead of a fox, but they were unsuccessful. ultimately workmenremoved some bricks and the fox was got out and given to the hounds.this case caused an outcry on the ground that the fox, who had giventhe hounds a good run, was the victim of cruel and unsporting conduct.a similar outburst was provoked by a hunted stag who recently tookrefuge in the channel, and was picked up and carried to france.that hunting is now condemned by the moral sense of the community notbecause of any increase in humanitarian sentiment, but because of achange in the interests of the predominant herd, is shown by the apathyof public opinion with regard to the victims of the gun and the motor.business men unable to hunt because of the obesity produced by theirhabits are not debarred from shooting. moors are hired in scotlandand all creatures liable to interfere with the supply of game areruthlessly exterminated. thus a squirrel-catching society has recentlybeen formed in aberdeenshire. rewards are offered for each squirrelcaptured, and it is estimated that between two and three thousandsquirrels are killed a year. at monte carlo business-men sit onterraces and shoot down pigeons which have been previously imprisonedin darkened boxes, with the result that, when they are let out intothe sunlight, they are too dazed to fly away. before they are placedin the boxes the tails of these birds are removed. this impedes theirflight and makes things easier for the business-men, who kill betweensixty and a hundred an hour. but it is not thought, except by cranks,that the business-men are immoral for amusing themselves in this way,although it is illegal in england for boys to steal the eggs of manykinds of birds.in the south of england, where the roads are tarred to facilitate thepassage of motors and the approach of business-men is heralded overthe countryside by a stink of tar and petrol, it is reported that theemanations from the roads have poisoned the waters of the test anditchen and caused the death of many of the living things that dwell inthem. even the fish, it seems, have begun to feel the march of progress.motors are frequently the cause of the death to hens, puppies, cats,and small children. yet nobody thinks the business man’s pursuit ofmotoring immoral. on the contrary, it is assumed without question thatthe road is his property, and that the pedestrian should make way forhim, while the risk to life and damage to limb consequent upon hisrefusal to do so are regarded as the results of culpable folly andnegligence on the part not of the motorist but of himself.business-men are given to amassing property, but not to making friends.it is not in personal relationships that they seek the good life, butin a plenitude of goods. for this reason current herd morality visitsoffences against property with greater severity than offences againstthe person. a man will get six months for stealing a diamond necklace,but only six days for beating his wife. but, though the ill treatmentof a wife by her husband is punished with comparative lightness,her appropriation by another man is considered to be the height ofwickedness. this is because the man who makes love to his neighbour’swife is committing an offence against property. for the same reason thedesire on the part of a wife to secede from her existing possessor andto be an independent entity maintaining herself by her own exertions isregarded with disfavour.[4] it is as if a valuable house were to insistthat it should remain uninhabited.  [4] cp. the success of a. s. m. hutchinson’s _this freedom_.those who belong to a herd are in general unable to understand the wishof others to escape from it. such a wish is an implied criticism uponthe herd conception, and brings a sense of insecurity. thus the desirefor leisure and solitude, or for a life amid wild surroundings, isregarded with instinctive disapproval. a frenchman recently exploringin brazil came upon a party of indians one of whom had a paler skinthan the others. the pale skinned indian turned out to be his long-lostbrother, who had lived among the indians for a number of years. theexplorer immediately set to work to persuade his brother to returnwith him to civilization. his efforts, however, proved unavailing.the brother asked why he should return to a community in which he hadto pay taxes, wear clothes and do other disagreeable things, whenhe could live with the indians in a state of nature without labourof any kind. the explorer had no answer to these questions. he wasunable to understand this refusal to return to the herd and accept therestrictions that existence in the herd involves. accordingly he toldhis brother that he was a hopeless degenerate, and left him to what hecharacteristically called his fate.something of the same feeling is entertained by the average man towardsthe artist or the writer. he distrusts the contempt of herd standardswhich his irregular life implies. this sentiment is reinforced by afeeling of insecurity in regard to possessions. the average man is toobusy to spare time for sexual immorality, and instinctively suspectsthe life of the artist or writer because of the facilities which itaccords for meddling with his wife during office hours. the generalnature of the objection entertained by the herd to sexual immoralitywill be examined more fully in the next chapter.before i close this chapter i wish to point out how the sentiments ihave endeavoured to describe have been intensified by the decay ofreligion.communities in which the average man is the stronger have always beennoted for their puritanism and high moral standard. promiscuity hashistorically been practised by the aristocracy rather than by themiddle classes, and in societies in which the standard is set by thelatter is visited accordingly with a disproportionate amount of moralobloquy. severer steps would no doubt have been taken against it,had it not been for the conviction that the sinner would be punishedhereafter. the poor man, lacking the rich man’s goods, has comfortedhimself with the story of lazarus. but the moral man has found equalconsolation when denying himself the pleasures of the flesh, inpicturing the eternal torments which awaited those who refused to bebound by his inhibitions.the average moralist has accordingly refrained from punishing thesuccessful libertine, knowing that god would do it for him. but thisconviction is no longer held. god is a much more mysterious being thanhe used to be, and we have less knowledge of his ways. it may be thathe does not exist at all, and in any event the belief that he will dothis or that, and, in particular, that he will entertain the same moralviews as we do ourselves, is no longer entertained with its old timecertainty. “vengeance is mine, saith the lord; i will repay.” perhapsit is, but it might be visited on the wrong people. in any event it issafer to take no chances, and to make sure that sinners shall sufferin this world the punishment which the eccentricity of god’s views maypermit them to forego in the next. for this reason it is to be expectedthat the herd morality of the future will develop a severer outlookupon derelictions from the standards of behaviour which it regardsas moral. what these derelictions are, and what are the reasons forsupposing that in spite of this attitude they are likely to increase, iwill consider in the next chapter.                              chapter iii                       the new liberty of actionimportant forces are, however, at work in the contrary direction.if the growing prevalence of herd morality will tend to place a newemphasis on the importance of uniformity, uniformity in the moralsphere is likely to prove more difficult of attainment.two factors in particular will militate against it. these are thegrowth of economic independence among women, and the practice of birthcontrol. let us consider these factors separately.i. the basis of the institution of marriage is economic. theologicalfactors have of course played their part. the early christian fathers,expecting the immediate end of the world, saw no reason to take stepsto ensure the continuance of the race. the christian hostility to thepleasures of the senses was, therefore, allowed to rage unchecked, andsexual intercourse was denounced as both wicked and unnecessary. astime passed, however, it was found that the world showed no signs ofcoming to an end, an inconsiderateness which led to the necessity fora change of attitude. the church met the situation with a complete_volte face_. it had previously stigmatized the sexual passions as sowicked that no christian should be permitted to indulge them: it nowpronounced them to be so sacred that no christian should be permittedto indulge them without the sanction of the church. the sanction ofthe church was given in marriage, a device whereby the fathers soughtto control and to regulate the workings of a passion they were unableto ignore. since then the church has claimed both the ability and theright to sanctify sex, and has looked with disfavour upon marriagesconsummated by the state as an infringement of her monopoly.but the fact that marriage has been instituted by god and cornered bythe church is not sufficient to account for its existence before thechristian epoch or its stability since. these rest upon an economicfoundation.throughout the recorded history of civilization the only recognizedway for a woman to make her living has been through her body. herbody being her one saleable asset, she could employ it in either oftwo ways. she could sell the use of it to one man for an indefiniteperiod, or she could lease it to a number of men for short and strictlyregulated periods. the first method is known as marriage; the secondas prostitution. the existence of these two, and of only these two,ways of gaining an economic livelihood has led to the formation oftwo unofficial women’s trade unions, the trade union of wives and thetrade union of prostitutes. the strength of these unions is directlyproportional to their monopoly of the economic field, and far exceedsthat of any recognized union in the more strictly industrial sphere.it is immediately obvious that any woman who was prepared to give forlove or for nothing what other women were only prepared to give formaintenance was a blackleg of the most subversive type, and the wholeforce of organized female opinion has, therefore, been devoted tomaking her position impossible. the force of female opinion so directedis known as morality, and the bitterness with which the free lover,that is to say, the woman who loves outside the marriage tie or theprostitute’s preserves, is denounced as immoral, is due to woman’sunconscious recognition of the fact that she is cutting at the basis ofthe economic livelihood of her sex.it is of course true that the two women’s unions are to some extentcompetitive, and that the existence of the prostitute threatens thesecurity of the wife while it guarantees the chastity of the younggirl. for this reason there is and always will be hostility betweenthe unions. the wife’s first commandment is the deity’s “thou shalthave none other woman but me”, and she is accordingly accustomed toregard the prostitute with horror, whereas she does not object to theexistence of other wives, since this does not, at least in theory,threaten her own. for this reason, too, the method of earning a livingadopted by the wife is generally preferred to that adopted by theprostitute, and is esteemed the more honourable by public opinion.so true is this that in most women the belief in the honourablenessof wifehood has become second nature, the really nice woman feelinginstinctively that the only decent way for her to live is on theearnings of some man. but while this feeling provokes hostility tomembers of the other union, it is a hostility which cannot comparein bitterness with the scorn and hatred felt for the free lover. thereason for this is obvious. the number of women a man can have formoney is limited by the extent of his income; the number of women hecan have for nothing is limited only by the extent of his ability tofind them. for this reason it is felt instinctively that the free loveris a greater menace to society than the prostitute. the prostitute,indeed, is and always has been recognized as a social necessity. sheguarantees the chastity of nice women by providing a necessary solacefor men up to the comparatively late age at which modern economicconditions allow them to marry. thus in tsarist russia the brothel wasa state-recognized institution. the new brothel was formally openedby the police officer, and was hallowed by a religious ceremony inthe course of which the premises were blessed by a russian orthodoxpriest.[5]  [5] _report of labour delegation_, 1925.sexual morality in men springs from the same economic source, but ismore limited in scope and less fiercely embraced. this is a naturaldeduction from what has just been said. if the livelihood of womenis bound up with the strict observance of the marriage tie, themaintenance of the moral restrictions upon which marriage as aninstitution depends is their special concern. in a purely promiscuouscommunity the livelihood of women would be intolerably insecure. hencewomen are the natural guardians of morality, knowing that it guaranteestheir bread and butter. it is not too much to say that morality as agoing concern is kept up by women. men on the whole, despite theirstrong property sense, are not interested in moral questions. theyhave not the woman’s delight in nosing out scandals, and, except whenthey are whipped up into a state of moral horror by their women folk,are much too prone to live and let live. the attitude of deliberateuncharitableness towards erring sisters which the sex affects doesnot come naturally to men, and left to themselves, they would condoneoffences which their outraged spouses insist on punishing with socialostracism.it is on the whole true to say that the moral sense, so far as sex isconcerned, only begins to function in men after marriage and, exceptin the case of one’s own daughter whose saleable value in the marriagemarket is thought to be diminished by inchastity, it centres upon thewife. since the wife is in origin a piece of property purchased by thehusband for his own enjoyment, to her must be extended the jealousguardianship which presides over property in general. the wife is themost valuable of a man’s indoor possessions; in return for the use ofher body he has agreed to maintain her in such dignity and leisure ashe can afford. this obligation to maintain the wife is a permanent onepersisting even after the enjoyment of her person has ceased. thuswhen a wife divorces or lives apart from her husband, he is usuallyrequired to maintain her, so long as she remains chaste. so soon,however, as she bestows the enjoyment of her person upon another, theobligation to maintenance ceases, presumably on the ground that thenew consumer should be saddled with the obligation of keeping up whathe enjoys. in nothing is the property basis of marriage more clearlydiscernible than in the ‘dum casta’ clause of the english divorce law.it is upon the same economic basis that the husband’s objection toinfidelity chiefly rests. if another man is permitted to enjoy fornothing what he himself has purchased at a heavy outlay, the husbandnaturally feels aggrieved. he is also rendered ridiculous. it is forthis reason that the cuckold is always presented in literature as acomic figure; he is in the position of a man who is unconsciouslyhaving his pocket picked. the husband’s predilection for fidelityin the wife is thus as strong as the wife’s demand for fidelity inthe husband――at times it is even stronger――and springs from the sameeconomic source. so long as the wife is in essence a piece of property,it is naturally felt that only the man who has paid for her shouldhave the use of her; so long as a woman can only obtain her living byselling herself to a man, she not unnaturally demands that othersshould not be allowed to undercut her.we have spoken of this situation as if it existed in the present; butit is already in many respects an affair of the past. the history ofthe last fifty years has recorded the growing and continuous influxof women into wage-earning employment which bears no relationshipto sex. women cure the sick, plead in the law courts, teach in theschools, do manual labour in garden, field, factory, and workshop, andserve increasingly as clerks, typists and shop assistants. three wererecently found among the five hundred applicants for the post of publicexecutioner in hungary.men have not unnaturally resented this change. the dependence ofwomen has on the whole suited them, and they do not like to see thosewhose economic helplessness has made them a natural prey to malepredatoriness rendered capable of standing on their own feet. havingdeliberately deprived women of the skill, the training, the knowledge,and the qualifications necessary to make their way in the world, menhave then proceeded to justify themselves by proving the moral andintellectual inferiority of women from the fact that she is ignorant,unskilled and uneducated. when it is remembered that the same causesthat have left woman no alternative but concubinage (married orunmarried) or starvation, have compelled her, as often as not, toperform the duties of an unpaid housekeeper, it is not difficult tosee how much man was the gainer by the transaction. but, unfortunatelyfor him, he has been unable to stem the rising tide of feminism. ithas long ceased to be true that a woman’s only means of earning herliving is by exploiting her sex-attraction, and all the evidencepoints to the fact that the number of women in wage-earning employmentwill be augmented in the future. this estimate leaves out of accountthe probability of the endowment of motherhood, which will place allmothers, whether married or unmarried, in the category of independentwage-earners.the effect of this economic change upon the situation i have brieflysketched, and upon the moral sentiments to which it gives rise islikely to be twofold.in the first place the unmarried woman will tend increasingly to formtemporary, irregular unions. this result will follow:(1) because her knowledge that she can earn her living in other wayswill not force her to demand from the man a pledge of life-longmaintenance as the price of her love.(2) because knowing that she is not dependent upon a man for herlivelihood, she will no longer have the incentive to pander to theman’s demand for virginity in his prospective wife by remaining chasteuntil marriage.(3) because a man’s abandonment of the connection which she has formedwith him, a process commonly known as desertion, will not as heretoforeleave her stranded without means of support.(4) because men will be less chary of forming temporary, sexualrelationships with women, when they know that they are not expected tokeep them.in the second place the married woman will tend to mitigate herhostility to irregular unions formed by unmarried women when sherealizes:(1) that her husband’s mistress, not being dependent upon him forsupport, will constitute a less formidable threat to her livelihood.(2) that the possible transference of her husband’s affectionsand consequent withdrawal of financial support will not leave hernecessarily incapable of finding other employment.(3) that, as the clear-cut line of demarcation between married andunmarried unions becomes obscured by the increase in the number of thelatter, it will no longer be either possible or necessary to put theunmarried mistress as completely beyond the pale of decent society ashas been customary in the past.from the above considerations it will be seen that the growingeconomic independence of women is likely, unless counteracted by otherforces, to lead to a relaxation of the marriage tie, to an increase inirregular unions, and to a growing tendency to dispense with marriagealtogether.but, some critics will object, what about the children? hitherto,i have left the children outside the scope of the argument, and itis high time to bring them in. this leads me to a consideration ofthe second of the two factors which i cited at the beginning of thechapter, the practice of birth-control.ii. that the practice of birth-control is likely to increase there can,i think, be no reasonable doubt. i am aware that there is considerableopposition to birth-control at the moment, and the various argumentsare brought forward to discourage people from employing its methods.these arguments are not held on rational grounds, but are dictatedby prejudices based on certain religious or political opinions whichthose who put them forward profess. it is said, for example, thatbirth-control is displeasing to the almighty, who invented sexualintercourse for the reproduction not of pleasure but of children; andit is thought, though not said, that it is injurious to the statebecause it will diminish the supply of cannon-fodder and cheap labour.as regards the almighty, whether he would agree with the views putforward by those who speak in his name is not known. until, therefore,we can obtain a direct expression of his opinion on the matter, itis more prudent to assume that his attitude is non-committal, thanto supply the place of knowledge by converting our conjectures intodogmas. as regards the supply of cannon-fodder, this is supposed to beimportant for consumption in future wars. since, however, those whooppose birth-control on the ground that it will diminish the number ofrecruits, also hold that wars are inevitable owing to the pressure ofexpanding populations, it would seem that populations which cease toexpand have no need to maintain large armies to protect them from theresults of expansion.the position of those who oppose birth-control being based on politicaland religious feelings of an emotional character is not, however,refutable by argument, or assailable by reason. our business is not toreply to arguments which have no rational basis, but to estimate whatinfluence they are likely to have in the future.there is, i think, little doubt that this influence will be adiminishing one. much of the opposition to birth-control is littlemore than an expression of the generalized feeling of hostility whichpeople experience in regard to anything that is new. whether it bea new morality, a new sonata form, a new way of wearing the hair, anew kind of corset (or none at all), or a new saviour of mankind withwhich he is presented, man’s natural and instinctive reaction is oneof antagonism. the antagonism is provoked not by any intrinsic demeritin the thing that arouses it――indeed in fifty or a hundred years timeit is embraced with acclamation as the last word in orthodoxy or goodform――but simply by its newness. the suggestion that any way of life,of thought or of conduct can be better than that which they havehitherto followed wounds people’s self-respect, and some time mustelapse before they can overlook the offence.this kind of objection applies in a marked degree to birth-controlwhich challenges people’s most intimate habits, and seems likely toeffect a revolution in their conduct. it will, however, diminish asthe idea of birth-control becomes familiar. the reaction of the normalenglishman to that which is new usually passes through three phases.he says first “it is absurd”, second “it is contrary to scripture”, andthird “of course! i knew it all the time”. it will be seen that theopposition to birth-control has already passed into the second phase.there is a further reason for the probable weakening of theanti-birth-control movement. the organized opposition to birth-controlcomes very largely from members of the upper and middle classes. theseon an average have very much smaller families than the lower classes inwhose interests they profess to oppose birth-control, and to whom theydenounce it. the inevitable inference from this fact cannot continueindefinitely to remain undrawn, and, as soon as it is drawn, thelower classes will be able to gauge the sincerity of those who exhortthem to choose between continence or children, while being themselvesremarkable for neither.finally the knowledge of the use of contraceptives is bound in courseof time to percolate through every social stratum. the advantages ofbirth-control to the individual are so obvious that few will refuse toavail themselves of the knowledge which the state, in the persons ofthe medical officers in charge of infant welfare centres, at presentwithholds; while the disadvantages to the community of a system underwhich the lower strata proliferate unchecked, while the upper andmiddle classes barely keep up their numbers, and the exceptional manwho has the talent and energy to climb from one stratum into anotherfinds it necessary to sterilize himself in the process, will, in theshape of a rapidly deteriorating population, force themselves upon thenotice of even the most pious.birth-control has come to stay; it has also knocked the bottom out ofwhat is called sexual morality.if the views put forward in the previous chapters be correct, ifmorality is the interest of the stronger, and if, where the strongeris the herd of average individuals, it expresses itself in disapprovalof conduct from which the average, for whatever reason, shrink,then the driving force of morality is to be looked for not in anyinnate sanction but in the power which the herd possess of renderingintolerable the lives of those who flout its prejudices. but in orderthat the herd may be able to exercise this power, it must be in aposition to detect the objects of its censure. this has been possiblein the past owing to the unfortunate propensity of sexual irregularityto result in offspring. it is not easy to disguise the existence of achild, and, even if the desperate course of overlaying or otherwiseextinguishing it be adopted, the disposal of the corpse presents gravedifficulties. such a course is also open to the objection of doinggrave violence to the humaner parental instincts. but birth-controlprecludes the necessity for children, and by so doing makes it possibleto “sin” without being found out.it is not to be expected that people will refuse to avail themselvesof the liberty thereby conferred. whether we are to infer that peopleare by nature sinful, or simply that a sin which has been manufacturedby herd morality is not really a sin, is a question that does notimmediately concern us. what does concern us is the impetus which thisability to avoid detection is likely to give to irregular intercourse.birth-control combined with economic independence has brought a newfreedom to women. economic independence enables them to have childrenwithout going either to the altar or into the workhouse. the practiceof birth-control makes it unnecessary even to have the children.one further result of birth-control may be noticed before we pass on.this is the probable abolition of the double standard of morality formen and women after marriage. that adultery in a wife has always beenconsidered to be more serious than adultery in the husband the stateof the law bears witness. adultery in a wife is a sufficient cause fordivorce, in a husband it[6] must be coupled with cruelty or desertion.this disparity of treatment has always caused grave offence to feministorganizations. yet the reason for the difference is not far to seek. itarises from the economic dependence of the wife upon the husband. asthe result of this dependence any children which the wife may acquirein the course of her adventures become a charge upon the husband, whois thus required to pay for the fruits of his own shame and another’senjoyment. it is true that he is, or ought to be, similarly responsiblefor the upkeep of the offspring which may result from his own adultery,but in this case he has at least had his pleasure and sinned his sin,and cannot in justice complain if his substance is consumed by itsfruits. where, however, adultery on the part of the wife does not carrywith it a risk of children to be maintained by the husband, it becomesan offence neither more nor less serious than adultery on the part ofthe husband, and the double standard ceases accordingly to operate.  [6] in july, 1923, the law was amended and adultery in the husband      became a sufficient ground of divorce.as a result of the above-mentioned considerations we may expect thatthe practice of birth-control will profoundly modify our sexual habits.it will enable the pleasures of sex to be tasted without its penalties,and it will remove the most formidable deterrent to irregularintercourse.it is this consideration which lies at the root of the opposition tobirth-control. deep down in most of us there lurks something of the oldpuritanical attitude, which insists that pleasure cannot or should notbe had without paying for it. this at least is true of pleasures we donot share. and it is this sentiment which is outraged by the immunityfrom the consequences of sexual pleasure which birth-control confers.the puritans objected to bear baiting not so much because of the painwhich it gave to the bear, as because of the pleasure which it gaveto the spectators. in the same way the great mass of decent middleclass citizens object to birth-control not because of the evil whichit does to the race, but because of the pleasure which it gives tothose who practice it. the puritans are up in arms; the dowagers, theaunts, the old maids, the parsons, the town councillors, the clerks,the members of vigilance committees and purity leagues, all those whoare themselves too old to enjoy sex, too unattractive to obtain whatthey would wish to enjoy, or too respectable to prefer enjoyment torespectability――in a word, the makers of public opinion――are outragedin their deepest feelings by the prospect of shameless, harmless andunlimited pleasure which birth-control offers to the young. and if theycan stop it it will be stopped.hence concurrently with the increased freedom which economicindependence and birth-control will give to young people, and to youngwomen in particular, there is likely to be a growth in restrictive andpurely inhibitory morality on the part of the middle-aged.we are in, then, for a wave of puritanism on the one hand combined withthe possibility of a new liberty of action on the other. what will bethe outcome?                              chapter iv                           the coming clashbefore i endeavour to answer the question with which i concluded thelast chapter, there are one or two additional considerations to whichit is necessary to refer, since they must affect our estimate of thefuture.i have spoken of the possibility of a new freedom for women due tobirth-control and economic independence. other factors are likelyto make such freedom more imperative on social grounds and lessintimidating on moral ones.the first is the great and growing preponderance of women in thecommunity. it is estimated that in great britain there are already twomillion more women than men, and the figures can no doubt be paralleledfrom other western european countries. our present moral code condemnsthese two million, and as many more as the number of bachelorsinvolves, to perpetual celibacy and sterility. in other words one womanout of every ten is expected to deny herself the right to motherhood orto become an outcast from decent society.this system is intolerable; it is manifestly breaking down in manydirections, and it continues at all only because public opinion amongwomen is still too unorganized to protest against it. it is alreadythe subject of wholesale disregard and infringement in practice, andit will be abolished in theory as soon as the social sense of thecommunity has progressed to the point of removing the stigma fromillegitimacy and the reproach from unmarried motherhood. in other wordsthe system is bound up with the man-made convention which insists thatthe right to have a child shall be saddled with the duty of lookingafter a man, and, since there are not enough men to go round, womenwill sooner or later be forced in self-defence to permit themselves tohave children without husbands.so far as the right to sexual experience, independently of the right ofmotherhood, is concerned, this is already safeguarded by birth-control.the growing surplus of women will tend, therefore, through thesheer pressure of virginity, to promote an increase in irregularrelationships, and to reinforce the movement towards freedom alreadydescribed.nor will religious considerations deter with their traditional force.i have already spoken of the decline of religious sentiment inconnection with the growth of moral rigour in the herd. lacking theconviction that god will punish wrong-doers, they arrogate the rightto themselves. but the same scepticism which lights the fires of theheresy-hunters encourages the wickedness of the heretics. if marriageswere not made by god, and torment in hell is probably not the resultof adultery, there is no longer reason to think that five minutes’bliss must be paid for in terms of eternal damnation. it is, no doubt,true, that god still loves the pure, but when earthly lovers areavailable, the price of god’s love may be not worth the paying. hencethe religious argument, though doubtless it will operate as a brakein a diminishing number of cases, will no longer act as a wholesaledeterrent.a more serious consideration is put forward in the name of biology.“you are,” the biologist will point out, “conducting your argument onthe basis of certain assumptions with regard to the nature of women,since you predict an increase in sexual irregularity not only amongmen, but also, and inevitably, among women. men, it is agreed, areregrettably promiscuous, in the sense that, even if they are monogamousin fact, they are varietist by inclination. but women are different.their nature is not varietist but monogamous, and it will, in spite ofall changes of material circumstances and moral sentiments, remain so.for this reason irregular sexual unions will not increase in the manneryou predict.”biological arguments of this type, derived from the alleged natureof women, are in my view mere man-made superstitions. the particularargument in question was invented by the peccant male who wished toconvince himself that, however flagrant his own infidelities, his wifewould remain faithful because it was her nature. the superstition wasalso useful, because it implied that, although a life of unvaryingfidelity might do violence to his natural proclivities, he need sufferno qualm of conscience in expecting and exacting conduct which herepudiated for himself from his monogamous wife. the notion too wasflattering and appealed readily to male conceit.now as to the existence of the facts asserted by my imaginarybiologist, there is, i imagine, little doubt. there are, of course,countless exceptions either way, but the general tendency is notobscure. while the cases of my lord and the barmaid are legion, thoseof my lady and the groom are notoriously few. but admitting the fact,are we to regard it as necessarily unalterable? many, i know, areinclined to do so. contemplating the domestic tragedies springing fromthe nomadic tendencies of the male, they have seen in them one morepiece of evidence for the satirical plan on which they believe theuniverse to have been constructed. if indeed there be design in thescheme of things, to what sort of design do the facts point? to havemade man polygamous and woman monogamous they regard as god’s worstpractical joke, and conclude that, whatever may have been the objectsand disposition of the creator of the universe, they were certainly notthose of a gentleman.but is the fact really unalterable? may it not be the outcome ofcenturies of servitude and seclusion, made absolute by the knowledgethat fidelity meant bread and butter and a home, infidelity starvationor the streets? since the beginnings of recorded history the greatbulk of women have, it is true, remained monogamous, but they may havedone so from fear of losing their jobs as wives if they did not. thosewho have been rich enough to stand upon their own financial feet, orpowerful enough to snap their fingers at public opinion, have not beenremarkable for strict observance of the marriage tie. the cases ofmessalina, catherine the great and the modern film star, not to mentiona score of less notorious instances, are instructive. significant toois the frequency of divorce among those who are sufficiently well todo to afford the enormous fees exacted by the legal profession fromthose who wish to change their partners. it is difficult, in the faceof evidence of this kind, to avoid the conclusion that the monogamoustendencies of women are the product of training, circumstance, andenvironment, and will not outlast the economic disabilities whichproduced them.in any event the present existence of these tendencies, if tendenciesthey be, affords no indication of what they may become in the future.the fact that the primitive savage could only count on the fingersof one hand does not invalidate the existence of the multiplicationtable, any more than the fact that most women want only one man eachnow proves that they will not want more in a hundred years. the use ofthe word ‘natural’ begs the question. we acquire those characteristicswhich our circumstances and environment demand, and then transmit themto our children in whom, being inherited, they are termed natural.but this does not mean that our children will not in due coursedevelop new characteristics of their own, if a change of circumstancesrenders the old ones undesirable. there are signs indeed that the newcharacteristics are already beginning to appear. the attitude ofrepresentative up-to-date women on this subject is curious. they tendto deny the difference between males and females which my imaginarybiologist alleged, and to declare that their inclinations are naturallyas promiscuous as those of their husbands. the circumstance that theycontrol them better argues, they assert, more sense; it does not implya difference in nature.remarks of this kind are often made by women who, nevertheless,live exemplary lives and would scorn to revenge themselves upon anunfaithful husband by imitating his conduct. nevertheless there is noreason to suppose that they deliberately misrepresent their feelings,and we can only conclude that, as usually happens, a new tendency ismanifesting itself in feeling some time before it is translated intoaction.for these reasons i do not think that any convincing arguments as tothe future can be based on the alleged monogamousness of women in thepresent. nor, so soon as the force of the monogamous habit wanes, do ithink that women will consent to put up with the manifest disadvantagesof a system which is based upon the assumption that it is as strongas it ever was. it is certain that they will not be deterred by theprotests of outraged males. conventional morality, as i have alreadypointed out, like many of our other institutions such as matinées,concerts and god, is kept going by women, and directly women withdrawtheir support, not all the opposition of men will avail to save it.what then is likely to happen?certainly not a relapse into complete promiscuity. the belief thatpeople are fundamentally licentious, and that a partial removal ofthe barriers with which society has hedged about the business ofreproduction will precipitate the population into a welter of unbridledlicense, pleasantly shocking though it is to the minds of respectablepeople, has absolutely no foundation in fact.this belief springs from the doctrine of original sin, which has alwaysbeen popular among quiet and well-behaved persons. if man is by naturewicked and sinful, and woman is very little better, then, indeed,contraception and the economic independence of women will lead to anorgy of sex indulgence in which the population will shuffle itself likea pack of cards.nothing of the kind is likely to happen.the purely sexual elements in love have come to occupy an entirelydisproportionate amount of attention owing to the taboos with whichthey have been invested. once these taboos are removed, they willrevert to their natural position of comparative unimportance. if itwere permissible to reproduce the sexual act upon the stage we shouldall lose our interest in chorus girls’ legs. moreover, playwrightswould not trouble to avail themselves of the permission.within reason, continence and constancy are natural to human beings. itis only the intolerable strain to which our absurd social arrangementshave subjected them that has caused us to regard ourselves as being bynature unfaithful and incontinent. there is no ground for the beliefthat the average man or woman who allow themselves to be guided bytheir own impulses must needs be scoundrels. for among their impulsesmust be numbered self-respect, moderation, and a sense of what is rightand fitting. because this sense may be, and often is, at variance withthe herd morality which is crystallized in the law, it does not meanthat it does not exist. on the contrary, it may be in advance of themorality it disowns, so that people thrown helpless on their passionsmay find that honesty, that self-respect, that hatred of cowardiceand deceit, and the desire for cleanliness, health, and efficiencywere master passions disciplining them far more effectively than theartificial inhibitions of a mediaeval morality based on an obsoletereligion and deriving its power from lethargy and fear.some changes in social arrangements there will no doubt be. in russia,for example, where the knowledge of birth-control is accessible toall classes, where any two parties by agreement, or either of thetwo parties by request, may obtain a divorce, and where no stigma isplaced upon illegitimacy, there has been a considerable relaxation ofthe family system.[7] if this means, as it probably does, that unhappyfamilies have broken up and that husbands and wives who disliked eachother have availed themselves of the opportunity to make a fresh start,we need not regret the change. nobody would contend that societyis the gainer by condemning the unhappily married to a lifetime ofdomestic misery, and it is difficult to see why the common sense ofthe community which considers the wishes of the parties concerned asufficient ground for consummating their marriage does not regard thewishes of the same parties as a sufficient reason for terminating it.  [7] _report of labour delegation_, 1925. it is interesting to note      that this relaxation has taken place concurrently with a marked      decrease in prostitution.on the other hand it is unlikely that those who are happily marriedwill rush to the registrar with the object of making themselvesmiserable by separating, simply because reasonable divorce laws givethem the opportunity to do so. it would be an interesting experiment,and one which would enable us to estimate the extent of maritalunhappiness, to proclaim a day of conjugal amnesty at recurringintervals. we might, for example, celebrate the coronation of everynew king by giving to all married couples the right to dissolvetheir marriages, and seek other mates. if advantage were not takenof the facilities offered within twenty-four hours, there would be acompulsory reversion to the _status quo ante_. or it might be betterto fix definite periods between the days of amnesty, so that theywould recur at regular intervals. each general election might serveas a signal for a conjugal general post, so that couples would havethe chance of gaining their freedom every five years. i myself wouldadvocate the institution of such amnesties, although i believe that theamount of conjugal dislocation they would cause would be surprisinglysmall. it is difficult to avoid feeling sentimental at the prospect ofparting even from those whom we dislike, and the fact that couples wereno longer bound in law would only tighten the bonds of sentiment. awould feel that, unpleasant as b had been, he could not very well lether down, and b would shrink from leaving a with no one to look afterhim, even when she had herself looked after him very badly. you cannot,in short, live with any one for a number of years without dreading theprospect of their loss. the knowledge, moreover, that quinquennialescape was possible might lead to married people treating theirpartners with at least the degree of civility they at present reservefor their acquaintances. i do not think, therefore, that the changescaused by a conjugal amnesty would be very extensive.for the above reasons i conclude that the social results of the changesi have been describing will amount to little more than a diminutionin the number of unhappy marriages, and an increase in the number ofexperimental unions.but it is not to be supposed that the herd will see the matter inthis light. nothing exceeds the license taken by the imaginations ofvery rigid people, and there is little doubt that the vast mass ofrespectable citizens, appalled and horrified by what they will insiston regarding as the prospect of growing and unlimited license, willrise to meet the situation with panic and persecution. and since, forthe reasons already given, morality in a modern community is thatkind of conduct which suits the stronger, we may expect a revival ofpuritanism expressing itself in a new robustness and acerbity in themoral sense of the herd.symptoms of this revival are not wanting in this country. if, however,we wish to see the clearest portents of what is coming we must, as ihave hinted above, look to america. america, as i have already pointedout, leads the world in morals as in everything else. that americancitizens set great store by morality is notorious. with their constantpurity crusades, puritan pogroms, vigilance committees, and popularjuries of selected citizens, who visit surreptitiously and reportupon the moral tone of new york plays, they put our more decadentcivilization to shame. on what sort of lines do these engines ofamerican morality take action? one instance must suffice. in april ofthis year, one miss jewell barker went bicycling in white knickers.her outraged neighbours showed their sense of this vicious act byproceeding to seize and flog miss barker’s father. this is at once tousurp and to invert the divine privilege of visiting the sins of thefathers upon the children.america is, of course, pre-eminently the land of liberty, and we cannothope to emulate her highest feats. efforts are, however, not wantingof our endeavours to live up to the standard our cousins set.i will quote at random one or two american examples with their britishparallels._america._ there is sumptuary legislation designed to check the licenseof the stage. “there is”, we are told, “a rule in some american townsthat the chorus girls must wear stockings, although the principals areallowed to appear with bare legs”._england._ in recent months there has been a strong provincial movementagainst the indecency and unpleasantness of the plays produced inlondon. respectable citizens complain that they never can tell whatsalacious beastliness may not be sprung upon their protesting eyes andears, what searchlight cast upon the augæan stables of high society.actors and actresses have expressed their views, pointing out thata pure stage is as good a paying proposition as a nasty one, andinvoking the case of the gilbert and sullivan operas to bear witnessto the truth of their contention. these operas, a notorious commercialsuccess, have never been known to bring a blush to the most bourgeoischeek. a number of london women have accordingly banded themselvestogether vowing to purify the stage. protests are to be made nightlyin theatres at which plays to which objection is taken are performed.“we shall stick at nothing,” said the leader of the campaign, “to makeour protest effective”.concurrently with this development there has arisen a demand for astricter censorship. i think it probable that we are on the thresholdof a period resembling the early seventeenth or middle nineteenthcenturies, when life as it is will be driven off the stage by thepuritans’ demand for life as it ought to be, love will give place tosentiment, and reality to romance._america._ a new teetotal version of the bible is promised fromamerica. the festive passages are all dry, the words ‘raisin cake’taking the place of the word ‘wine’ wherever the latter occurs in theauthorized version. thus we have “and he dealt to everyone of israel,both men and women, to everyone a roll of bread, a portion of meat anda cake of raisin”._scotland._ steps were taken in the spring of this year to transfer toscotland a film depicting the explorations of livingstone. an extractfrom the daily paper tells us that “prohibitionists there are alreadystrenuously objecting to the incident which shows livingstone, afterhe has been found by stanley, drinking champagne with his rescuer!the difficulty is that the incident is historically correct ... andthe problem is whether truth should be suppressed in the interests ofmorality. ‘at any rate’ said the secretary of the london missionarysociety ‘the raising of the question _is evidence of the progress madesince his time_.’” it can scarcely be doubted that if the meeting hadtaken place to-day, livingstone would have acknowledged the march ofprogress by drinking water.a straw shows the direction of the wind, and i should not be at allsurprised to see scotland go dry in the next fifty years, especially ifshe is successful in obtaining home rule. if scotland goes dry, it isnot to be expected that england will fail ultimately to follow suit.the increase in efficiency among dry workmen is very great, and ifthe business men remain “the stronger” in the community, they cannotcontinue indefinitely to be blind to its advantages, especially as theythemselves would be immune from the hardships it entails. if we askwhether an officially dry but unofficially wet business class, and aworking class which is dry both officially and unofficially, does notmean one law for the rich and another for the poor, our answer is thatconventional morals always does mean this.[8]  [8] cp. the case of the legs of the chorus and the principals, p. 70.the practice of virtue, we are often told, is dependent upon thepossession of a sufficient income. it is only the well to do who canafford to be generous, honest, and unselfish, because they have notemptation to be otherwise. but what is true of virtue is equally trueof vice, and the experience of the working of prohibition in americashows how easy it is for the rich to procure illicit indulgences whichare out of the reach of the poor.there is likely to be legislation against wantonness in dress. bywantonness is meant the practice among females of unnecessarilyexposing parts of their body. the curious belief that the body is insome way disgraceful, and that the exhibition of it is, therefore,wicked is very prevalent among western peoples. it arises partlyfrom natural prudery, partly from the property view of marriage,and partly from the inclemency of the climate which makes bathing acomparative rarity. the japanese who have a bath twice a day, observeno discrimination between the sexes in their bathing. “one day”, saidthe marquis of x who had just returned from japan, “my wife went tohave a bath, and she got as far as the rinsing stage when two youngjapanese came in. she had to take refuge in the tank, screaming at thetop of her voice until the two young men were taken away. they nodoubt thought her a very fastidious young woman”.the conviction that the body is wicked and ought to be concealed isimportant, because it leads women to expose portions of it which theywould otherwise protect, and rightly protect, from the rigours of theatmosphere, in the belief that they are making themselves attractive.thus women swathed in layers of furs in respect of the rest of theirpersons, will venture forth on the coldest day with bare bosoms andopen-work stockings. it is with the same object that, though theirreligion bids them mortify the flesh and refrain from making ofthemselves a stumbling block to others, they will appear at dinnerwith necks, bosoms, backs, and arms completely naked, a proceeding notonly acquiesced in but encouraged by their males. this sort of thingis anathema to the herd, who cannot afford the evening dress and thefurs, and to the old, the condition of whose bodies does not, exceptin the case of the incurably optimistic, permit them to take the sameliberties as their daughters. hence we may expect a considerablestiffening of public opinion in the matter of decorum in dress and areturn to the days in which everything except the hands and the facewas carefully covered up.in the sphere of what is called sexual morality we may expect a growingtendency to make wickedness (that is to say conduct which is not in theinterests of the stronger) punishable by law. attempts will be made,and successfully made, to multiply crimes by act of parliament.a good example of this tendency will be found in the bill entitled_the children, young persons, etc., bill_, introduced by a labourmember during the tenure of office by the labour government in 1924.it represents bourgeois or herd morality “in excelsis.” it is known asthe _offences against the person bill_, and its object is to codifyand extend the existing enactments against abortion, cruelty tochildren, offences against children, and neglect of children. many ofits provisions are admirable and afford what is no doubt a necessaryprotection to children against suffering and neglect. nevertheless itmenaces individual liberty in two ways. in the first place it increasesthe number of offences punishable by law, often in an arbitrary manner.for example, it is made a crime punishable by two years hard labour fora girl of sixteen to have intercourse with a young man of eighteen, thecriminal being not, as one might have expected, the elder of the twoparties concerned, but the girl. she alone is liable to imprisonment;the young man is allowed to go free. it is also a criminal offence toconceal the birth of a dead child, to cause or encourage a child tobeg, or to celebrate the marriage of a boy and a girl under sixteen,such marriages being declared invalid.in the second place the bill authorizes grave interference withpersonal privacy. the officers and inspectors charged with executingits multifarious provisions are given unlimited powers of search,and authorized in certain cases to arrest without warrant. even ifa bill of this kind were to be administered by angels or sages, theopportunities for espionage and surveillance which it bestows wouldbe sufficiently offensive. since, however, its provisions will infact be enforced by inspectors and constables drawn from the lowermiddle classes, who will be only too willing to denounce as flagrantimmorality whatever transcends the experience of clapham, the measurestands revealed as an attempt to endow the herd with increased powersof interference and control over the private lives of those who ventureto stand outside it.encouragement would also be given to malevolent and offensive personswho wished to do harm to their neighbours by laying information againstthem. in general, liberty would be diminished, offences multiplied,and the individual rendered more subservient to public opinion than isthe case to-day.another expression of herd feeling will be a growing tendency toenquire into the private lives of those who hold public appointments.the herd, that is to say, will increasingly demand of those who fillpositions of eminence and authority in the land that they shallconform in practice, and profess to conform in belief, to the code ofprejudices and preferences which it pretentiously calls its morals.even to-day, at the end of half a century of individualist thinking,fitness to perform a particular job is one of the least importantqualifications in a candidate. what is important is that he shallbe a member of a recognized religious sect, such as the church ofengland or one of the sub-sects of nonconformity, that he shalllive with one wife, avoid divorcing and being divorced, and displaystudiously temperate habits. he must also exercise discretion in hispublic utterances, be judiciously but not violently patriotic in hissentiments, eschew extreme views in politics, refrain from supportingunpopular causes, and on all occasions give the herd the answers itexpects. thus in wales it is difficult if not impossible for a man tohold any public appointment unless he is a member of a particularchapel, and at english universities many teaching posts are reservedfor those in holy orders. given the capacity for reflecting theopinions and flattering the prejudices of the many, men of acknowledgedincompetence may successfully aspire to the most responsible posts.there is indeed no post in the country a man cannot hold with credit,if he can only succeed in holding his tongue.conformity rather than intelligence is more particularly required ofthose who seek to instruct the young. a man’s ability to demonstratethe differential calculus or impart the facts of history would not, itis true, appear to be lessened by his having passed through the divorcecourt. yet there is no doubt that such an event will cast a blight uponhis career as a teacher. people are too satisfied with their own waysof thought and habits of conduct to wish for their children anythingbetter than that they should think and act as they do themselves. whatis demanded of the teacher, therefore, is that he should transmit tothe children the same beliefs as those which are held by their parents.he must hold up to their admiration those things which their parentsconsider to be admirable, such as god, vaccination, monogamy, thetreaty of versailles and the capitalist system, and speak with scornand contempt of bolshevism, atheism, germany, free love and agitators,whom parents consider to be evil. when the teacher does this he is whatis called a safe man. he inspires confidence and obtains preferment.provided, in short, that he guarantees not to teach anything new, hiscapacity to teach anything at all is not seriously questioned. and,since the best minds of every generation, being in advance of theirtime, would prefer not to teach at all rather than to perpetuate thedogmas in which they have ceased to believe, the successful teacher isnot always remarkable for intelligence.in any event, whether intelligent or not, he must conform, and willhave to do so increasingly. the herd morality which drove a statesmanof the calibre of dilke out of public life because it disapprovedof his private life, is, after a temporary relapse, increasing instrength, and in the immediate future nobody who does not profess themorality to which the middle classes adhere will stand any chance ofpublic office. if a man’s actions belie his professions he must becareful to conceal them.one of the results of this development will be an increase inhypocrisy. to-day the agnostic don at oxford worships regularly inthe college chapel, and men will be driven increasingly to givelip-service to ideals and shibboleths which in their hearts theydespise. in general, the gulf which separates public profession andprivate practice, a gulf which has made england a byword for hypocrisy,will grow wider. driven to profess the beliefs of shopkeepers, men willrely increasingly upon their private judgment as a sanction for theirconduct. hence the attempt to impose a uniform standard based upon anobsolete morality upon our public men may lead to a revival of thatunfashionable organ the private conscience, and those from whom anunwilling conformity is exacted in public, will insist that they andthey alone are the judges of what is right and wrong in private.i have taken the _offences against the person bill_ as a typicalinstance of the kind of legislation in which the new puritanism mayexpress itself. it indicates a return to the greek conception that mencan be made good by act of parliament. in the late nineteenth and earlytwentieth centuries this conception was regarded with disfavour. as theresult of the individualist thinking of the preceding fifty years, theidea that there was one good life which all men ought to lead had beenabandoned. the individualist view was that there were different kindsof good lives for different men, as many in fact as there were men tolive them, and that it was, therefore, impracticable to establish bylaw a positive standard of ethical conduct to which all must conform.in so far as law had any function in the matter, it was, by prohibitingviolence and the cruder forms of robbery, to guarantee to the communitya certain background of order without which no good life was possible.since the mere process of obeying the law did not make a man a goodman but only restrained him from certain unappetizing kinds of viceby which no decent upper or middle class citizen was attracted, itfollowed that the function of the law was negative merely; its objectwas to prevent citizens from so conducting themselves that nobody couldbe virtuous, not to define virtue or to tell men how to attain it. thedefinition of virtue was a matter for the individual’s insight, andthe attainment of virtue a matter for the individual’s conscience;provided, therefore, that a man abstained from the grosser forms ofanti-social conduct which were prohibited by law, the question of whathe ought to do, and what refrain from doing, was one which he alonecould decide.i believe that this nineteenth and early-twentieth centurylibertarianism in matters of thought and conduct is decreasing and willcontinue to decrease. the cult of uniformity is hostile to the libertyof the individual, and in order to secure the performance of conductof which the herd approves, the legi
